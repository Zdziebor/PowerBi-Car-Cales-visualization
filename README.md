# PowerBi-Car-Cales-visualization
Visualization of Car Sales offers from a Polish car sales site. 

Visualization is based on a Data Set available on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aleksandrglotov/car-prices-poland/data) presenting Car Sales offers stats from polish Car Sales site.

I have adjusted some of the values to match my requirements. Specifically I have removed some values from provinces column which were not polish voivodeships.

Visualization is interactive, meaning user can filter values based on Car mark, Production Year and Fuel type.
